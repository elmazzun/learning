# Learning Linux

This repository acts as a personal knowledge store.  

Each directory contains a precise topic.

## Structure

* `challenges`: some code challenges, either done out of boredom (`over-the-wire`),  

  or to prepare for job interviews (`amazon`)

* `custom-modules`: using Linux kernel modules in order to explore kernel

  mechanisms

* `k8s`: learning Kubernetes

* `namespaces`: before learning Docker, explore the kernel primitives that

  made possible Docker containers

* `networks`: learning about net stuff

* `utils`: some scripts that may be used as helper tools, like a `nmcli` wrapper

## Misc

* I adhere to [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
