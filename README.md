# Learning Linux

This repository acts as a personal knowledge store: this is what I learned on

Linux. Each directory contains a precise topic.

## Structure

* `custom-modules`: using Linux kernel modules in order to explore kernel

  mechanisms.

* `namespaces`: before learning Docker, explore the kernel primitives that

  made possible Docker containers.

* `over-the-wire`: when I'm bored, I do some of these challenges;

  * `bandit`: as the site says, *this is for absolute beginners* but it is

    better to remember the fundamentals and not to leave gaps in knowledge.

## Misc

* I adhere to [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
